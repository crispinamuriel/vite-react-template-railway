        'My passions are Tech, Learning, and Education. I have received credentials to teach elementary school in California and New York. As a user of educational apps in my classroom, I was always inspired at how technology seemed to motivate my class to learn. I loved my time spent working with children and am proud to have contributed to the EdTech field that reaches many children in a meaningful way. \n \n For the past three years I have immersed myself in coding and constructing full stack applications for various clients. Working with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python has been an exhilarating journey, allowing me to unleash my creativity within the realm of web application development. I have been actively participating in diverse projects as a Full Stack Developer. I notably collaborated on an educational app, a fintech app, two health tech apps, signup and payment flows, marketing websites, and an internal insurance underwriting app.',
